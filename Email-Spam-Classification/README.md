## Email Spam Classification System using Naive Bayes 

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.

Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.

Naive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.

**Case study:** Build a email spam filtering system for a email service provider to detect and filter out the spam emails from the list of emails in the dataset. Use Naive Bayes algorithm to complete the case study and calculate the accuracy of the model.
